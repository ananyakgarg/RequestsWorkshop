API workshop set-up guide for HackNC 2022

Hi! 

Welcome to the requests workshop. 
Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started with working with REST APIs in Python. 

We'll be using the 'requests' library in Python to make an API call, get data, and print to the console. Then, I'll demo a simple API project completed in Swift, using the same REST API concepts.


## Let's get started
- Pre-requisites
  - A working laptop
  - Stable internet connection
  - An IDE that runs Python (if you do not have Python installed, navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/ to access an online IDE for the sake of the workshop)
    -   **Access this repository later once you download Python!**


## The API
We'll use the Data-Muse API (https://www.datamuse.com/api/), a word-finding query service that provides users with a set of words given a certain constraint and context. 
API Link- https://api.datamuse.com/

For example, we can find words that sound like "karat", or words that rhyme with "forgetful", or even ask the API to give us words that mean something similar to "hosting a workshop"! 

 Clone this repository to follow along to the demonstration!
